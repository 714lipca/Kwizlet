Before running the scripts make sure that the proper libraries such as googletrans and pytesseract are installed.
In case of pytesseract you should also make sure that the Tesseract OCR executable is downloaded and installed as well as path 
to it is properly given in scanner.py 


1. Add the photo you want to exrtact text from to the program directory
2. Change the PATH variable to name of your photo
3. Run the scanner.py (words longer than 5 letters (it can be changed) will be automatically translated and saved in proper format in flashcards.txt)
4. Run main.py and enjoy the very simple version of the program which randomly shows you the words and their translations
